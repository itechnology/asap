ASAP - Ad Server: A Simple Ad Proxy Ad Server


---
PlaceHolder for future project


##What is it ?

I call it an Ad Proxy, because it's not really a full blown Ad Server. What it does is take a collection of availiable tags and enables you to insert a unique tag on all your pages and websites (which means no more changing tags when you switch agencies and the likes..), yet distribute the correct tags to the correct audience, on the correct domain, page, placement, and desired format.

Tags are distributed on a geolocalized basis, and it's possible to target specicif users by age, sex, and other criteria. You can enable/disable tags on the fly, and apply various distribution ratios amongst ad agencies, and many other things.


##How does it scale ?

Pretty damn well ! On a shared machine while serving around 5 Billion Ads/Month, it uses like 5-10% CPU, and insignificant bandwidth..


##When can i get it ?

Out of legal reasons i can't release the code as-is, so it will be ready whenever i get the time to get around to rewriting it to be even better and with more configuration & backoffice facilities ..unless of course someone wants to sponsor the project to get things rolling faster.
